Points: 5
Position: 50, 200

One instance of the Apache web server can serve multiple websites (e.g. www.example.org and www.another-example.org). Each website is called a "Virtual Host" and has a seperate configuration file, partly overriding global configuration directives.
 
All configuration files of apache are located in "/etc/apache2"
There is a Virtual Host called "default" provided when installing Apache which gives the "It Works" message. 

Write the values and a short explanation of the following Apache configuration variables to your /root/apache.txt file
 
* DocumentRoot
* ErrorLog
* APACHE_RUN_USER
* APACHE_LOG_DIR

Commands hint:
~~~
# grep -r PATTERN FILE
