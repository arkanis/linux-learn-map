## Introduction

This document describes how to set up an Apache web server for serving documents (PHP & HTML sites, multimedia files etc.) over HTTP to a web browser. This is the base for the popular combination of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python which is called a "LAMP" system. The tutorial is tested on Debian 6.0 Squeeze.

To work with this document you need

* knowledge how to work on a UNIX command line (runn commands, find help, edit text files)
* a Virtual Machine with DNS name like http://linuxvmXXX.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de
* a Terminal that has access to linuxvmXXX.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de with HTTP and SSH (work from the PC Pool or with an OpenVPN connection)

Login on your virtual machine
~~~
$ ssh root@linuxvmXXX.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de
~~~
 
Before you begin installing a new application, make sure that you have updated your server to the latest updates

~~~
# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
~~~

## Install the main package

In order to prevent memory problems in your virtual machine, change the Multi Processing Module we directly install the "prefork" mode (exchange for package "apache2-mpm-worker")
~~~
# apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork
~~~
